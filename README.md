# About Me

I am a computer science graduate - University of Haifa. I have a passion for technology and enjoy solving complex problems through programming.

## Education

- Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, University of Haifa - GPA 84.

## Skills

- Proficient in programming languages such as Java, Python, C++ and C.
- Familiar with data structures, algorithms, machine learning and Deep learning.
- Familiar with software engineering principles and methodologies.

## Projects

### Project 1: Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Management System

Developed an information system for HMO using Java, JavaFX, SQL and maven framework. Implemented features such as user authentication, reserving medical appointments, managing partial medical information, featuring scheduling, COVID-19 test and vaccination management, and report generation for healthcare facility management.

### Project 2: Survival of the fittest game

designed a simple survival game using unity and C++. Survival of the Fittest is a strategy survival game where the objective is to survive as many rounds as possible. Each round is progressively harder than the previous one, with different types of zombies spawning with varying strengths and play styles.

### Project 3: Weather prediction project - deep learning 

created a many-to-one bidirectional LSTM model (Recurrent neural network) as these types of models are suited for time-series forecasting tasks such as weather prediction, where given a sequence of days, we predict the mean_temp and sunshine values for the next day.  
Libraries used in this project includes: Pytorch and tensorFlow.
